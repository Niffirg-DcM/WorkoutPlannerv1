# My Personal Project

## *Fitness Program Generator*

# Proposal

This application will be designed for fitness enthusiasts to quickly create a **customizable workout plan**. The application will generate a fitness routine based on the user's muscle groups of choice and will provide the ability to remove and add an **infinite amount of exercises** of the user's choice. There will be pre-existing exercises to be added to the workout routines. Additionally, the user will be able to add their own exercises to the routines through a name and number of repetitions needed. The user will also be able to create and remove different workout routines as they like.

### General Goals:
- Auto Generating workout plans
- User selection of exercises
- ability to add and remove exercises
- ability to add and remove workout plans
- ability to add exercises to list of already existing exercises
- ability to retain workouts and new exercises after closing and reopening the application

## *My Interest*
For the past 4 years, I have made the gym a part of my life. I exercise 3-5 times a week, every week. Due to the time I spend in the gym, I often have people asking me for advice about what to do and how they should exercise. Beyond researching on their own and getting a workout plan given to them, there isn't much I can assist them with within a short period of time. As such, developing a tool to circumvent this issue would help not only those who want to exercise but also would help me compartmentalize the information I already know and help me develop a more effective routine for myself. This would **automate** the process giving the individual as much freedom (or lack thereof) to create their own workouts as they would like.

# User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to create an empty workout plan and add it to a list of workout plans.
- As a user, I want to be able to add exercises to a workout and *then* add it to the list of workout plans.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a workout plan and add exercises to it.
